		<h3><u>1:</u> <strong>The Hartford</strong></h3>
		
		<p>The Hartford, also known as "The FARTford", is #1 on our list because it's just the worst. They have bad data, bad wizards, and their castle honestly kinda sucks. Their red wizards hate computers, and their blue wizards are gone, and their only purple wizard, SHEEN MAHEEN, is hopelessly underpowered. We don't even know if they do insurance, or if they just say business buzzwords like SYNERGY and TEAM at each other in meeting rooms all day.<br><br>Every year since my first exposure to The Hartford, I've asked Santa Claus for one and one thing only: for this place, and everyone in it, to be removed from this plane. I've even tried repenting for my many horrible sins so that I can be a "good boy", but the Fat Red Genie's arbitrary ideas of morality keep him from giving me what I, and by extension, the world, <strong>deserve.</strong></p>
