		"Dungeon Rock is alleged to have been the site where pirates, who sailed up the Saugus river to ransack various settlements, buried some of their treasure. As with all stories of forgotten treasure, this has lead to lunatics who think they will discover holy artifacts and mountains of gold. However, it's just an empty cave. In fact, the officials in charge of Lynn Woods have installed a giant iron door on the entrance to the cave to that stupid people don't hurt themselves and/or die in the cave, and you can only enter the cave on a (rarely) scheduled official tour. <strong>i personnaly perfer the abandond buildings that you can see in lynn which is very close to lynN wWoods, where this rock is. Click on :"Abandoned Buildings" page in tops of page to see those</strong>" <strong>(emphasis added)</strong></p>
