		<p class="contentDescription">Lynn was once had so many shoe factories that it was a significant center for their manufacture on a global scale. Lynn shoes were known around the world, and the industry made Lynn incredibly wealthy. However, these days are long gone, and now Lynn is known mostly as a poor and opportunity-void place to live; a place to escape. There are so many abandoned buildings that they actually aren't considered to be of much note, and as such there are scant pictures of them online. Thus, this now-dated picture of a functioning factory.</p>
