		<p class="contentDescription">This was once Mark Twain's house. Some people think he was racist; others say his characters were merely accurate portraits of the people of his time. However, there <i>is</i> agreement that he liked little girls. <br><br>Also, he's dead now, so you can't actually visit him.</p>
