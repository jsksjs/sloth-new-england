		<p class="contentDescription">These two theaters once shared a building. In fact, they still do, but neither of them operate anymore. As their names imply, they were once opulent spaces dedicated to theatre and film, but as business declined, they became increasingly desperate to stay afloat, even going so far as to show adult films.<br><br>In the end, this sacrifice of dignity was for naught, as they both went out of business within the year.</p>
