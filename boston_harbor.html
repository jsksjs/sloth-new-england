		<p class="contentDescription">You may be asking: <i>Why should I go to Boston Harbor, instead of any other harbor out there? What makes Boston Harbor so special?</i><br><br>Well, the answers are, <i>you shouldn't</i>, and, <i>nothing</i>. The most-often cited reason why Boston Harbor is better than the thousands of other harbors out there is its history. Like that one time 243 years ago, when a bunch of Englishmen dressed as Native Americans threw tea into the harbor, or that time in 1919 when there was a literal flood of molasses.<br><br>But that all happened so long ago. Boston Harbor does NOT taste like tea, and it absolutely <strong><i>does NOT taste like molasses. It tastes like GARBAGE. Don't drink the water.</i></strong><br><br>So really, all the cool things that used to make Boston harbor interesting are long-gone. I don't know what the biological half-life of tea or molasses is, but today, you'll see neither racist cosplayers nor this cool scene depicted by the Boston Globe of the time:<i><br><br>"Molasses, waist deep, covered the street and swirled and bubbled about the wreckage  ... Here and there struggled a form‍—‌whether it was animal or human being was impossible to tell. Only an upheaval, a thrashing about in the sticky mass, showed where any life was  ... Horses died like so many flies on sticky fly-paper. The more they struggled, the deeper in the mess they were ensnared. Human beings‍—‌men and women‍—‌suffered likewise."</i><br><br>With that gone, there is <strong>no reason</strong> to visit Boston for its port. Go there for any number of <strong>other legitimate attractions that aren't ports.</strong></p>
