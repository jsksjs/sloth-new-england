		<p class="contentDescription">Every year, Revere holds a sand castle-building contest. At least, it calls it that, but in reality, the sculptures are made with such skill and on such grand scales that the label does them no justice.<br><br>However, for the remaining 98% of the year, the beach is covered in trash and other biological matter. This picture is pretty dim, but that's just because of the miasmatic fog of misery that covers the region.</p>
