		<p class="contentDescription">The Salem Witch Trials was a really cool temp event that the devs decided would make the game more fun, but it kinda backfired. Basically, they used some RNG to make some NPCS <i>really</i> hate specific players, usually women, and it made them sorta just lynch or "legally" execute them. It was supposed to make the game more exciting, but really it was a bit of BS because you couldn't really do anything if you were one of the randomly-targeted players.<br><br> Modern scholars have varying interpretations of the event. Some say "riding the broom" and "meeting in the woods to dance with the Devil" were metaphors for masturbation and lesbian orgies, but that's dumb.</p>
