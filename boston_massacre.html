			<p>The site of the Boston Massacre. <i>"Why haven't they renovated this building? It must be at least 50 years old."</i></p>

		<p class="contentDescription">In 1770, some Brits got mad and shot 11 of our lads. There might have been "harrassment" with "snowballs" that had "rocks" and "ice" in them, but BRITS ARE TWITS AMIRITE?<br><br>Unfortunately, today, the massacre has ended. So you can't actually go see the Boston Massacre. You can only stand where it happened and think real hard about being shot by royal officials, or getting clubbed during the melee. Make sure to bring tissues for your eyes when you cry.</p>
